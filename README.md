# No-Loss Auction Diamond Contract

The No-Loss Auction Diamond Contract is a decentralized smart contract system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. This contract enables the creation and management of zero-loss auctions for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens (ERC-20) in a secure and transparent manner.

## Features

- **Zero-Loss Auctions**: Participants in the auction gain rewards even if they are outbid, ensuring a fair and incentivized bidding process.
- **Support for ERC721 and ERC1155**: The contract supports both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards, allowing for auctions of both single and multiple NFTs.
- **Customizable Auction Parameters**: Parameters such as starting bid, auction duration, and incentive distribution percentages are configurable to suit various auction scenarios.
- **Security**: Built with security in mind, utilizing best practices in smart contract development to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Integration with AUC ERC20 Token**: The diamond contract serves as both the auction house and the native token contract (AUC ERC20), providing seamless interaction between auctions and token transfers.

## Usage

1. **Creating Auctions**: Owners of NFTs can initiate auctions for their assets by specifying auction parameters such as starting bid and duration.
2. **Bidding**: Participants can place bids using AUC ERC20 tokens. Bids trigger incentive distributions to ensure zero-loss auctions.
3. **Claiming Rewards**: Participants receive rewards even if they are outbid, incentivizing active participation in the auction process.
4. **Ending Auctions**: Auctions automatically end after the specified duration, with the highest bidder winning the NFT and rewards distributed accordingly.

## Getting Started

To deploy the No-Loss Auction Diamond Contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a compatible Ethereum development environment or tool.
4. Interact with the deployed contract through supported methods and functions.
